# Predicting taxonomic identities of DNA sequences based on codon usage

This machine learning project aims to utilize codon usage information of nucleic acid molecules to predict the taxonomic domain of the organism to which the nucleic acid belongs. This project works as an additional proof-of-concept for the close connection between an organismâ€™s genetic code and its taxonomic classification.

The project's source code is included in the Report.pdf file.
